# RandomStuff
String manipulation / RegEx


Purpose of this project is to have fun with looping through strings, make string regex a little bit easier for myself with certain inputs, and other things.

Rot-n cipher has already been added ~~but there currently is a problem with storing the exact locations of the uppercase letters, that should be fixed in the next couple of hours.~~ <-fixed

Probably going to recode this in C++, then C, then python for the fun of it.

Any questions just comment or w/e


Currently writing psuedocode for seqCheck, and I promise the code will be ugly (but highly commented).  You don't find a sequence by playing pattycakes, now do you?
